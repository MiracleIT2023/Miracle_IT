            Couple of years back we have organized a workshop on Industry 4.0
            and Artificial Intelligence. Where Microsoft and other IT giants
            have given the presentation on the AI and discussed its usage in
            world of 21st century. It was the beginning of another revolution. We have already witnessed three major industrial
            revolutions so far - In 1784 it was about Steam, water, mechanical
            production equipment; In 1870 it was observed for Division of
            labour, electricity, mass production; And in 1969 it was for
            Electronics, IT, automated production. <br/><br/>The next revolution will be
            in the context of blurring the physical and the digital divide
            (observed started in 2016). Digital transformation is the next
            industrial revolution which will be known as Industrial Revolution
            4.0. It will be majorly lead by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
            followed by machine learning, Data analysis and robotics.
            AI possesses established together of the
            leading technologies of the 21st century. It’s now become a crucial
            a part of modern organizations that intelligently integrate data,
            analyze critical information, and utilize the derived insights for
            creating better decisions. We never knew that we would require AI in
            so urgency. Let us discuss the necessity of AI in post covid-19
            era. AI has been transforming every facet of recent businesses while
            simultaneously bringing great convenience for people through its
            applications. Both AI and automation are playing significant roles
            within the modern wave of digitalization. The novel corona virus has
            further highlighted the importance of digital readiness for
            businesses. Hence, the already healthy pace of AI and automation
            adoption is predicted to receive an exponential push as companies
            have begun to look for technologies that make them future proof and
            digital-ready. In studies it's been proved that AI grew 270 percent
            from 2015 to 2019. Another study by Fortune Business Insights
            claimed that AI and automation are getting to be extremely crucial
            for the healthcare industry amidst the pandemic. Further, it
            revealed that the worldwide AI market is predicted to grow at a
            Compound Annual rate of growth (CAGR) of about 33.2 percent from
            2019 to 2027, reaching a worth of $267 billion in 2027 from $27.23
            billion in 2019.From tracking the COVID-19 Symptoms via smart
            wearable devices to mining and deriving the virus strain to help
            build better test kits, AI has been a real technology enabler for
            the Healthcare Industry during the pandemic. Even otherwise, AI and
            automation are a superb support to businesses across industries in
            these testing times. We have been getting some excellent news from
            various parts of the world that the vaccination has got started for
            the novel corona virus. This provides a great hope to the whole
            world which has been devastated by this deadly infectious virus.
            While we hope to determine the post-COVID era soon, let’s plan to
            understand some AI and automation trends which can continue
            empowering businesses within the Post COVID-19 world. Applications
            of AI across Industries AI technology has been introduced already
            across various sectors like manufacturing, mobility, education,
            e-commerce, communication, health, insurance, finance, and lots of
            others. These are just a couple of samples of AI applications in
            some industries: • Manufacturing: Largest Industry where robots & AI
            technology are demanded the foremost . High-performing robots as
            compared of the normal labour mechanism, can work faster for
            extended periods then no end , as long as they need access to an
            influence source). it's proved that in some cases, they will be more
            efficient than humans. • Automobile: using AI to drive the automated
            and Autonomous cars, so we will take a nap while commuting to
            figure. It’s not impossible neither each day dream now. Anyways, AI
            applications are integrated into every car manufactured now-a- days.
            From voice assistants to drive semi-autonomously. AI already has
            become an important a part of the Mobility industry today. •
            Healthcare: AI plays an important role within the health sector's
            technological advancements, from autonomous surgical robots, virtual
            nursing assistants to automated image diagnosis. And there's still
            some space for more applications because the technology improves.
            There are more possible applications of AI that would be utilized in
            automated transportation of products, global climate change,
            deep-sea and space exploration. A Door to the New world With current
            Artificial Intelligence and machine Learning capabilities businesses
            can sift through useful data more efficiently than ever before. Not
            only text or numbers but diverse inputs including spoken, written,
            or image inputs are often analyzed easily today. This empowers
            organizations to seek out business-critical information from more
            varied data sets. It not only reduces business expenses but also
            creates new trade opportunities. We have seen AI algorithms quickly
            shift through enormous amounts of knowledge during the COVID-19
            pandemic, helping to spot similar diseases and their potential cures
            for speeding up the corona virus research work. Machine Learning
            advancements are expected to assist businesses create new revenue
            streams by enabling them to raised monetize their data. Having
            access to valuable data points helps in numerous ways. For example,
            information associated with the efficacy of a particular drug on
            people during a particular age bracket is very insightful to
            pharmaceutical companies and drug researchers. Emerging AI and ML
            processing algorithms and protocols are going to be more insightful
            for businesses and can move for fresh, profitable market
            opportunities within the post-covid-19 era.The Bottom LineThe
            ability to constantly learn and adapt to changing circumstances is
            what separates AI from other technologies. It has lead to innovative
            applications like intelligent data processing, face and voice
            recognition, etc. One can say AI will have a far better impact on
            businesses within the supply chain and retail industries, but its
            applications in other industries are promising also . With the pace
            at which various organizations have adopted innovative, emerging
            technologies like AI and ML during the pandemic, it's obvious that
            the post-Covid-19 era are going to be even more advanced and
            hospitable sophisticated technologies and their application
            software, apps, app is not only capable of delivering a better,
            faster, safer, and more accountable future but also promises to fill
            the space between data-backed decisions and human intuition. This
            will enable businesses and their consumers to transact with the best
            trust. According to PWC CEO Survey, report says that 86% CEOs of the
            world believe that AI technology will transform their business more
            than any other global trend. AI is expected to be an inseparable
            part of the post-pandemic world, empowering businesses to attain
            unimaginable growth and efficiency. Hence, it might be critical for
            businesses and professionals to revisit their business strategies to
            accommodate AI and its applications for being relevant within the
            post-COVID-19 world .For Learning more about this you may please
