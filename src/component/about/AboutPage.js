            Coding is the new literacy! Just as writing helps you to organize
            your thoughts and express your ideas, the same is true for coding.
            Coding enables you to craft your own interactive stories and games,
            thus expressing yourself creatively on the computer.Even in the New
            Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) government has emphasized on IT
            education at school level. <br />
            <br />
            In our JUNIOR curriculum we have introduced HTML and CSS go hand in
            hand for developing flexible, attractive, and user-friendly
            websites. HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is used to show content
            on the page whereas CSS is used for presenting the page. <br />
            <br />
            In our SENIOR curriculum, students will develop the skills to
            program in Python language with an understanding of the concepts of
            basic programming in an open source environment. This course will
            enable the students interested in computer science to understand the
            functionality and solve the exercises as per the CBSE Python for
            class 11th and 12th guidelines.
